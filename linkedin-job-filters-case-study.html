                    <p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>
                    <p>Job seekers on LinkedIn often feel stuck reviewing the same jobs over and over — this feature aims to change that. The goal is to evaluate whether LinkedIn should add an "unviewed jobs" filter to help users discover new opportunities faster.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Users waste significant time on previously seen jobs, creating frustration and reducing job search efficiency.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>If LinkedIn adds an "unviewed jobs" filter, then job seekers will find relevant opportunities faster and have a more efficient job search experience.</h2>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2>THE MARKET</h2>
                    <h3>What can we learn from competitors?</h3>
                    <p>Industry standard across job platforms like Indeed, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter is to provide various filtering options to help users narrow down their search results.</p>

                    <h4>Indeed</h4>
                    <p>Indeed offers comprehensive filters including "Recently Posted", "Salary Estimate", "Job Type", and "Company". They also have a "New" filter that shows jobs posted within the last 24 hours.</p>

                    <h4>Glassdoor</h4>
                    <p>Glassdoor provides filters for "Date Posted", "Salary Range", "Job Type", and "Company Size". They also highlight "Easy Apply" jobs and allow filtering by application method.</p>

                    <h3>A few common themes across all job platforms:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most platforms offer time-based filters (recently posted, new, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Users can typically save searches and set up alerts for new postings</li>
                        <li>Platforms track user behavior to improve recommendations</li>
                        <li>Filtering by application status (applied, not applied) is becoming standard</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                        <li>Users need better ways to focus on new opportunities</li>

                    <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>

                        <li><strong>AI-Powered Search Summaries:</strong> After a job search session, LinkedIn could summarize: "You've already viewed most Data Analyst roles in Tel Aviv — try widening your search to nearby cities."</li>

                    <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> This feature addresses a clear pain point and could significantly improve job search efficiency for LinkedIn users.</p>

                    <p>I recommend implementing an "Unviewed Jobs" filter for LinkedIn's job board. This feature addresses a clear pain point for active job seekers who feel stuck reviewing the same opportunities repeatedly.</p>

                    <p>The MVP should focus on simple filtering with persistent user preferences. Success should be measured by meaningful reduction in time-to-application and increased user satisfaction.</p>

                    <p>If the A/B test shows positive results, LinkedIn should consider expanding with the "Unviewed Recommendations" widget and AI-powered search summaries. These advanced features would differentiate LinkedIn from competitors and provide significant value to job seekers.</p>
